Linux things I don't wanna lose

- **.bashrc** - bash session, with custom prompt and various small things
- **archsysupdate** - arch update and clean (uses `topgrade` for updates, `paccache` for pacman and yay cache, cleans `docker` unused things)
- **cheatsh** - query `cheat.sh` with `curl` and pipe into `less` 
- **getaddr** - get LAN and public IP address (with `ip` and `curl`)
- **irc** - launch detached `irssi` with `tmux`
- **neofetch.conf** - `neofetch` information configuration
- **restard_kde.sh** - restart KDE
